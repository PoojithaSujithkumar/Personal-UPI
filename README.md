# ðŸ“Š Personal UPI Financial Insights App

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project is a part of my self-driven exploration into combining AI with personal finance.  
**PersonalUPI** is a simple UPI transaction analyzer built using **Gradio**, **Google Gemini API**, and **PyPDF2**.  
It reads Paytm (or similar) PDF transaction histories, extracts the data, and uses Gemini AI to generate personalized financial insights to help manage spending better.
