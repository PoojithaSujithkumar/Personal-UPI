# Personal-UPI
A simple personal UPI transaction analyzer built with Gradio, Google Gemini API, and PyPDF2. The app extracts text from Paytm (or similar) PDF transaction histories and generates detailed financial insights, including monthly income and expenses, unnecessary expense categories, savings estimates, spending trends, and cost control suggestions.
